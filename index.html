<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Musicians are encouraged to share their files as widely as possible.
Listeners are empowered to support the authors of their favorite songs. We
forget about DRM and copy protection because they simply stop making business
sense.
<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>10 seconds of an audio stream are always enough to produce payment info for
the artist. The listener&rsquo;s interfaces make it easy to find and use this
payment info.
<p>We accomplish this without any centralization using a robust, imperceptible,
reversible audio watermarking algorithm and Bitcoin.
<h2>Help</h2>
<p>Sound fun? Want to make this happen?

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a double entendre. It means the same as &ldquo;copyright&rdquo;
if you take &ldquo;just&rdquo; as in &ldquo;justice&rdquo;. But it can also be
taken as a simple injunction: just copy.

<p id="foot">No &copy;. Just copy.
